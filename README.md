# CSC405-SwampCTF-OrbOfLight1
Attempt to solve Orb of Light 1 from SwampCTF

The message is decoded but I have no idea of what the 
flag is. I tried a few possibilities such as encoding
and decoding "flag" or "secret". I am not sure of how
to proceed. The encoding and decoding scripts with the
known dictionary are attached. Run from some CLI using
Python 3.
