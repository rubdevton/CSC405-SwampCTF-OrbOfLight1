Dominion of shadows and unusual things

"Toxic domain of dark illusion
Land that shrouds loathing light
boundary of worlds unknown"

Land of shadows, a twilight domain that is a dark mirror, or copy, of you world. a point of blight and corrosion, a domain out of sync, a land with horrors right by you and you donâ€™t know.

Artisans of a thaumaturgical kind do not usually cross into lands of shadow for in such domains an unknown horror is said to lurk.  Arrival always brings about dissolution of aspirations for shadows quickly swallow souls of light in a mystic impossibility.  A solitary augury was proof: Kingdoms will fall as conjuration of shadow glooms midday with dark malicious fog, a luminous charm will cast a ray that again aligns our world.
